## Discussion

I used the following technologies:

- HTML/CSS
- Redux Toolkit : state management
- React

I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4)
to generate the scaffolding for this app.

## Highlights

- Routing implementation
- Code organization/architecture
- Integration tests
- Error handling
- - UI handles unreliable Api
- Modularity

## Bonuses!

- Notification for error or bad network request

## Requirements

- List are artist.
- The user should be able to see all artist and albums.
